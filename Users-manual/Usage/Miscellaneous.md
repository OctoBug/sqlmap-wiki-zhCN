## Miscellaneous

### Use short mnemonics

Option: `-z`

It could become tedious to type all desired options and switches, especially for those that are used most often (e.g. `--batch --random-agent --ignore-proxy --technique=BEU`). There is a simpler and much shorter way how to deal with that problem. In sqlmap it's called "mnemonics".

Each option and switch can be written in a shorter mnemonic form using option `-z`, separated with a comma character (`,`), where mnemonics represent only the first arbitrarily chosen part of the original name. There is no strict mapping of options and switches to their respective shortened counterparts. Only required condition is that there is no other option nor switch that has a same prefix as the desired one.

Example:

```
$ python sqlmap.py --batch --random-agent --ignore-proxy --technique=BEU -u "ww\
w.target.com/vuln.php?id=1"
```

can be written (one of many ways) in shorter mnemonic form like:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -z "bat,randoma,ign,tec=BEU" -u "www.target.com/vuln.php?id=\
1"
```

Another example:

```
$ python sqlmap.py --ignore-proxy --flush-session --technique=U --dump -D testd\
b -T users -u "www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1"
```

can be written in shorter mnemonic form like:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -z "ign,flu,bat,tec=U,dump,D=testdb,T=users" -u "www.target.\
com/vuln.php?id=1"
```

### Alerting on successful SQL injection detection

Option: `--alert`

### Set answers for questions

Option: `--answers`

In case that user wants to automatically set up answers for questions, even if `--batch` is used, using this option he can do it by providing any part of question together with answer after an equal sign. Also, answers for different question can be split with delimiter character `,`.

Example against a MySQL target:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.22.128/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1"--te\
chnique=E --answers="extending=N" --batch
[...]
[xx:xx:56] [INFO] testing for SQL injection on GET parameter 'id'
heuristic (parsing) test showed that the back-end DBMS could be 'MySQL'. Do you 
want to skip test payloads specific for other DBMSes? [Y/n] Y
[xx:xx:56] [INFO] do you want to include all tests for 'MySQL' extending provide
d level (1) and risk (1)? [Y/n] N
[...]
```

### Make a beep sound when SQL injection is found

Switch: `--beep`

In case that user uses switch `--beep` he'll be warned with a beep sound immediately when SQL injection is found. This is especially useful when there is a large bulk list (option `-m`) of target URLs to be tested.

### Cleanup the DBMS from sqlmap specific UDF(s) and table(s)

Switch: `--cleanup`

It is recommended to clean up the back-end database management system from sqlmap temporary table(s) and created user-defined function(s) when you are done taking over the underlying operating system or file system. Switch `--cleanup` will attempt to clean up the DBMS and the file system wherever possible. 

### Check for dependencies

Switch: `--dependencies`

sqlmap in some special cases requires independent installation of extra 3rd party libraries (e.g. options `-d`, switch `--os-pwn` in case of `icmpsh` tunneling, option `--auth-type` in case of `NTLM` HTTP authentication type, etc.) and it will warn the user only in such special cases. But, if you want to independently check for all those extra 3rd party library dependencies you can use switch `--dependencies`.

### Disable console output coloring

Switch: `--disable-coloring`

sqlmap by default uses coloring while writting to console. In case of undesired effects (e.g. console appearance of uninterpreted ANSI coloring codes like `\x01\x1b[0;32m\x02[INFO]`) you can disable console output coloring by using this switch.

### Use Google dork results from specified page number

Option: `--gpage`

Default sqlmap behavior with option `-g` is to do a Google search and use the first 100 resulting URLs for further SQL injection testing. However, in combination with this option you can specify with this option (`--gpage`) a page other than the first one to retrieve target URLs from. 

### Use HTTP parameter pollution

Switch: `--hpp`

HTTP parameter pollution (HPP) is a method for bypassing WAF/IPS/IDS protection mechanisms (explained [here](http://www.imperva.com/resources/glossary/http_parameter_pollution_hpp.html)) that is particularly effective against ASP/IIS and ASP.NET/IIS platforms. If you suspect that the target is behind such protection, you can try to bypass it by using this switch.

### Make a through testing for a WAF/IPS/IDS protection

Switch: `--identify-waf`

sqlmap can try to identify backend WAF/IPS/IDS protection (if any) so user could do appropriate steps (e.g. use tamper scripts with `--tamper`). Currently around 30 different products are supported (Airlock, Barracuda WAF, etc.) and their respective WAF scripts can be found inside `waf` directory.

Example against a MySQL target protected by the ModSecurity WAF:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.21.128/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --i\
dentify-waf -v 3

```

Skip heuristic detection of WAF/IPS/IDS protection

Switch: `--skip-waf`

By default, sqlmap automatically sends inside one of starting requests a dummy parameter value containing a deliberately "suspicious" SQL injection payload (e.g. `...&foobar=AND 1=1 UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE 2>1`). If target responds differently than for the original request, there is a high possibility that it's under some kind of protection. In case of any problems, user can disable this mechanism by providing switch `--skip-waf`.

### Imitate smartphone

Switch: `--mobile`

Sometimes web servers expose different interfaces toward mobile phones than to desktop computers. In such cases you can enforce usage of one of predetermined smartphone HTTP User-Agent header values. By using this switch, sqlmap will ask you to pick one of popular smartphones which it will imitate in current run.

Example run:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://www.target.com/vuln.php?id=1" --mobile
[...]
which smartphone do you want sqlmap to imitate through HTTP User-Agent header?
[1] Apple iPhone 4s (default)
[2] BlackBerry 9900
[3] Google Nexus 7
[4] HP iPAQ 6365
[5] HTC Sensation
[6] Nokia N97
[7] Samsung Galaxy S
> 1
[...]
```

### Work in offline mode (only use session data)

Switch: `--offline`

By using switch `--offline` sqlmap will use only previous session data in data enumeration. This basically means that there will be zero connection attempts during such run.

### Safely remove all content from output directory

Switch `--purge-output`

In case that user decides to safely remove all content from `output` directory, containing all target details from previous sqlmap runs, he can use switch `--purge-output`. While purging, all files from (sub)directories in folder `output` will be overwritten with random data, truncated, renamed to random names, (sub)directories will be renamed to random names too, and finally the whole directory tree will be deleted.

Example run:

```
$ python sqlmap.py --purge-output -v 3
[...]
[xx:xx:55] [INFO] purging content of directory '/home/user/sqlmap/output'...
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] changing file attributes
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] writing random data to files
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] truncating files
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] renaming filenames to random values
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] renaming directory names to random values
[xx:xx:55] [DEBUG] deleting the whole directory tree
[...]
```

### Conduct through tests only if positive heuristic(s)

Switch `--smart`

There are cases when user has a large list of potential target URLs (e.g. provided with option `-m`) and he wants to find a vulnerable target as fast as possible. If switch `--smart` is used, only parameters with which DBMS error(s) can be provoked, are being used further in scans. Otherwise they are skipped.

Example against a MySQL target:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.21.128/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?ca=17&use\
r=foo&id=1" --batch --smart

### Select (or skip) tests by payloads and/or titles

Option `--test-filter`

In case that you want to filter tests by their payloads and/or titles you can use this option. For example, if you want to test all payloads which have `ROW` keyword inside, you can use `--test-filter=ROW`.

Example against a MySQL target:

```
$ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.21.128/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --b\
atch --test-filter=ROW
[...]

```

Option `--test-skip=TEST`

In case that you want to skip tests by their payloads and/or titles you can use this option. For example, if you want to skip all payloads which have `BENCHMARK` keyword inside, you can use `--test-skip=BENCHMARK`.

### Interactive sqlmap shell

Switch: `--sqlmap-shell`

By using switch `--sqlmap-shell` user will be presented with the interactive sqlmap shell which has the history of all previous runs with used options and/or switches:

```
$ python sqlmap.py --sqlmap-shell

### Simple wizard interface for beginner users

Switch: `--wizard`

For beginner users there is a wizard interface which uses a simple workflow with as little questions as possible. If user just enters target URL and uses default answers (e.g. by pressing `Enter`) he should have a properly set sqlmap run environment by the end of the workflow.

Example against a Microsoft SQL Server target:

```
$ python sqlmap.py --wizard
